Source Code and Data for the paper "Evaluating hunter-gatherer settlement patterns in mountain environments: the role of research biases and locational strategies in the spatial organisation of Mesolithic upland sites of the Dolomites (Eastern Italian Alps)"

The results are slightly different from those published, as we have been using a slightly different (and more precise) landuse categorisation, and a more accurate insolation estimation. 

We also decided to update from GRASS 6 to GRASS 7, in order to facilitate the reuse of the code
